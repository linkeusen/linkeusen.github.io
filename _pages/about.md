Hi~😄,This is our first meeting，right?

Perhaps I should start with a brief introduction of myself😎

I am very easygoing 😊 and have a wide range of hobbies:

Hiking🧗‍♂️ (the best way to connect with nature)
Reading📖 (recently enjoying Navarre's "...Guide to Happiness" immensely)
Swimming🏊‍♂️ (helps me stay calm and relaxed)
Movies🎬 (immersing myself in a film is like entering another parallel world...)
Music 🎵(allows my soul to briefly transcend the rules of the world)
Exploring new gadgets and innovations (all sorts!!! Can't resist buying something intriguing when I see it)
... (Let me think of more)
Anyway, you would definitely feel comfortable hanging out with me.


I believe life should be beautiful. I aspire to work in a role where I can create value for society while realizing my personal worth, rather than merely surviving. 
For over twenty years, I've lived within predefined boundaries: excel in academics, avoid anything unrelated to textbook knowledge. 
I know I've missed out on many career paths I once dreamed of pursuing (like fashion design, music creation, writing novels...).
If life were a movie, I'd want to understand more about the characters in this film, to learn about all the novel things in this world. 
So please, don't define me by any one thing, degree, or profession. In the script of this world, I can play any role well!💪

======
I'm sure you'll find your way here and we'll be able to build a great relationship🌹.
